      "1.1\tPURPOSE\n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose of this Request for Proposals (RFP) is to secure an administrator(s) for the statewide Commonwealth of Virginia employee health benefits program, The Local Choice (TLC) health benefits program, and the Line of Duty Act (LODA) health benefits plans.  These self-insured programs anticipate relatively few benefit changes to the current plan designs. Successful offerors will be expected to incorporate changes to plan design and program components at any time, including at initial implementation, as required by law or requested by the Department of Human Resource Management (the Department).  Statewide refers to any eligible employee or former employee, regardless of location.  This requires nationwide and, in some cases, international access to coverage.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The RFP contains six (6) separate components for which individual submissions may be made. These components are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Statewide Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) and High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) Medical/Surgical, Behavioral Health (to include Employee Assistance Plan (EAP)), Vision, and Hearing administrative services for the state employee, TLC, and LODA plans;\n",
      "\n",
      "Statewide Consumer-Driven Health Plan (CDHP) Medical/Surgical, Behavioral Health (to include EAP), Vision, and Hearing administrative services for the state employee plan;\n",
      "\n",
      "Statewide PPO, HDHP, and CDHP Prescription Drug  administrative services for the state employee, TLC, and LODA plans;\n",
      "\n",
      "Statewide PPO, HDHP, and CDHP Dental administrative services for the state employee, TLC, and LODA plans;\n",
      "\n",
      "Fully-insured regional plans for state employee and TLC programs; and\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 125 Flexible Spending Account administration for state employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any submission must address all elements of a given component. \n",
      "\n",
      "The TLC program is an optional health benefits program administered by the Department for political subdivisions of the Commonwealth.  The LODA Health Benefits Plans cover eligible public safety employees/volunteers permanently injured or killed in the line of duty and/or their eligible family members. (The LODA Plans are not exempt from ERISA.)  Please note that Flexible Benefits will not be included in the TLC program or the LODA plans.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The objectives of the programs include providing better than average benefits administered in a very cost-effective manner with excellent service to enrollees, so that state agencies and participating local jurisdictions can recruit and retain high quality employees.  \n",
      "\n",
      "1.2\tBACKGROUND\n",
      "\n",
      "The Department is the authorized agent of the Governor in administering the state employee health benefits program.  The program is delivered through approximately 219 state agencies to some 100,000 active full-time and part-time employees, 10,000 retirees not eligible for Medicare, and 500 extended coverage (COBRA) enrollees, and to the dependents of these enrollees.  Agencies distribute program materials to active employees, assist employees in applying for coverage or changes in coverage according to rules developed by the Department, payroll-deduct employee premiums (with some exceptions), post eligibility information onto the Benefits Eligibility System (BES), and otherwise assist employees in accessing the program’s benefits.  Participants who do not receive pay from which to deduct premiums (e.g., some retirees and COBRA participants) will be billed by the selected Offeror for the Medical/Surgical product.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The Department also has the responsibility for administering a health benefits program, The Local Choice (TLC), which is offered to localities statewide as a replacement option to other health benefits program choices.  Any local government, school district, or political subdivision may join this program.  Presently there are 440 member groups covering approximately 45,000 employees, retirees and their 32,000 covered dependents.  The Department offers a choice of benefit designs to TLC member groups.  Currently, the choices of plans include PPO, HDHP and HMO plans using a variety of coinsurance, co-payments, and deductibles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Department also administers a health benefits program, the LODA Health Benefits Plans, which is described in Section 1.1 above. Presently there are 1,100 participants and their 1,400 covered family members in two (2) non-Medicare LODA plans, one based on current and the other based on former employment. Both of these plans are PPOs. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Department has developed plans and programs with the advice of consultants, vendors, employees and others, and has delivered benefits through Contractors, either insurers or third party administrators.  The coverages currently available for the state employee and LODA plans may be found on the state employees’ web site: www.dhrm.virginia.gov., The coverages currently available for TLC plans may be found on The Local Choice web site: www.thelocalchoice.virginia.gov.   \n",
      "\n",
      "1.3\tGENERAL DESCRIPTION\n",
      "\n",
      "The Department currently offers three statewide self-insured plans for state employees, a PPO (COVA Care), an HDHP (COVA HDHP), and a CDHP (COVA HealthAware). The Department also currently offers a regional fully insured HMO to state employees within the applicable service area.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The TLC program currently offers four self-insured plans designed around a PPO called Key Advantage.  These include Key Advantage Expanded, Key Advantage 250, Key Advantage 500 and Key Advantage 1000. In addition, a self-insured HDHP and a regional fully-insured HMO are available.  It is anticipated that there will always be a degree of choice in TLC to better meet the needs of the different groups and to ensure the program remains competitive in the marketplace. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Department wishes to receive offers for the statewide plans on an Administrative Services Only (ASO), self-insured basis. It wishes to receive offers for less than statewide plans on a fully insured basis. However, the Department is under no obligation to implement such fully insured plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "This RFP is divided into sections, such as this numbered Section 1.0, Introduction.  A section is one of the principal divisions of this RFP.  Within these sections, numbered subsections are the second principal division and normally contain the number of the section in which they are located, such as subsection numbered 1.3.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It is imperative that Offerors respond to all applicable requirements and complete all applicable schedules and exhibits described in the Form of Response, Section 6.  Any Offeror confusion about which sections/subsections and/or paragraphs may be applicable to a potential Offeror should be clarified no later than the mandatory pre-proposal conference.\n",
      "\n",
      "This RFP embraces coverage for Medical/Surgical, Behavioral Health including EAP, Dental, Pharmacy, and Flexible Benefits.  For scoring requirements concerning all plans, refer to the Section 6.7 of this RFP.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This RFP also does not address coverage for Medicare Retiree benefits.   Benefits for the Medicare Retiree Program, including the Medicare Part D benefit, will be procured at a later date for an effective date on or after January 1, 2020, but not later than January 1, 2022.\n",

The Contractor(s) will be reimbursed for payment within three business days through an electronic transfer of funds.

This procedure will be finalized with each Contractor as part of the negotiation process and the cycle may be varied based upon compelling reasons, such as claim volume and dollars.\n",

In this process, the Department will review the invoice and authorize reimbursement through the EDI process. Again, the billing documentation will consist of a cover invoice providing the administrative dollars in total for each program with a summary for all programs, and documentation which supports the summary invoice. This support will at minimum consist of a breakdown by each program of billing units by price per unit, shown for the current period and year to date. The number of billing units for each employer under the TLC program will also be required. The monthly administrative invoice may also be used as the financial transfer document for miscellaneous non-claim items that are either due from or to the Department when supported by clear documentation.

The self-billing process is run on the fifth working day of each month of coverage based on all first-day eligibles and takes into consideration any retroactive changes. The self-billing file includes all eligibles for a Contractor shown by agency and premiums due. The file is transferred electronically to the carrier and at the same time generates the request for payment. An EDI transfer around the 10th working day of each month makes payments.

The program operates under regulations established by the Commonwealth of Virginia. The regulations require completion of a formal application by a prospective group, and the Medical/Surgical underwriters and Department’s actuaries provide the applicant with monthly premiums for each of the plans which are available to the group based on the size of the group and, if applicable, the area of the state. A group may join the program at the beginning of any month, but all groups renew with a July 1 effective date (except for some school groups that may choose an October 1 renewal date). A prospective group joins the program by completing a legal adoption agreement and submitting a document containing the plan choices that they will offer to their employees. The choice of the plans is an employer decision within the parameters established by TLC based on group size, and their employees may only choose from the plans selected. Contractors will provide them with the material needed to conduct the initial enrollment.\n",

October renewing school groups hold open enrollment during August or September.  Open enrollments will be for a 30-day period.  Standard enrollment/waiver forms are provided to the groups by the program, along with summary information on plans offered. An on-line enrollment process is planned for the future.  Each Contractor is required to provide a toll-free customer service line to provide information about their plan and to receive orders for plan specific materials for use by  the group's benefit administrator.\n",

      "Each year, TLC groups go through a formal renewal process in which they are provided the full menu of plans available in their area with the premiums for the upcoming plan year. The number of plans that can be offered by each group is based on group size.  The renewal process starts on September 15th prior to the upcoming July 1 or October 1 effective date when groups are provided with premiums for the next plan year. The communications development for the upcoming year begins immediately with the involvement of all Contractors. The paid claims data for the self-funded plans is pulled through December 31 for each group and is rated along with current demographics and the costs of the pooled products. The Contractors’ underwriters proceed to develop rates by group for each self-funded and fully-insured plan and print a complete proposal of available plans. Proposals are assembled and delivered to member groups by February 28. The groups then have until April 1, or July 1, as applicable to their renewal date, to either renew or withdraw from the program. Renewing groups conduct open enrollment as described above. and are responsible for getting enrollment changes to the Department by June 1 or early September , depending on the renewal date.  Groups withdrawing from the program must be evaluated for any adverse experience adjustment.\n",
